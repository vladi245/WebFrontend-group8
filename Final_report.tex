% SHORT HISTORY

\section*{Short History}
Adjustable desks have become an important part of modern workplaces by reducing the negative effects of sitting too long and increasing the general health and productivity of employees. Many design trends have changed the office environment over the years but recently integrating smart technologies such as IoT have become more popular. By connecting IoT technology with a smart desk, user can enjoy the convenience of pushing a button to achieve better ergonomics, health, and well-being while working at your desk. Our project, in collaboration with LINAK focuses on making the workspace smarter,healtier, and more productive.

% ABSTRACT

\section*{Abstract}
\paragraph{} GetStanding addresses the growing need for healthier work environments by integrating reliable technology into adjustable desk systems provided by LINAK. The primary objective is to improve the functionality and user experience of adjustable desks through a web-based application. (WAITING FOR THE OTHER SECTIONS)

\section{Introduction}
GetStanding is a web based application developed as part of a university course project, based on cases provided by LINAK. It addresses the challenge of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, while working in an office environment.

\subsection{Motivation}
Prolonged sitting can harm both wellbeing and productivity, yet people often forget to stand, stretch, or take short breaks throughout the day. Additionally, the lack of integration between work routines and fitness apps makes it difficult to accurately track and assess physical activity, limiting the ability to maintain a healthy, active lifestyle.

\subsection{Objective}
Our objective is to help people keep track of their habits. The way we do this is through GetStanding, an application that presents user given data in a clear, easy to understand, and intuitive format. Habits like workouts, time spent standing, and meals get tracked on graphs on a weekly basis.  Having the options for a user to select their own height and based on that, through an algorithm, GetStanding gives a recommended standing and sitting height. One of the most important objective for us was to get this done through one application. GetStanding, unlike other fitness tracking applications, also has the capability to connect to a sit and stand desk, to track the user's time spent standing or sitting. Another objective was to make a way for users to keep track of each other through a friends activity feature. This would ensure that a user would return to GetStanding. And lastly, getting rewarded for keeping good habits, such as spending a certain amount of time standing, is also a good incentive. 

\subsection{Delimitation}
Most of our problems were related to the time limitations we had. We wanted to add other features, such as a friends page and rewards, but have decided that we do not have the time capacity to implement them. Our planning was also not always the best, and because of this, some tasks ended up being delayed, making it harder to move forward with the project as a whole. As for the application itself, a limiting factor can be if the user is not constantly keeping track of their workouts, water and food consumption. In this case, the charts will not be able to present the improvement in their habits.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Development Process and Collaboration}
Based on the knowledge the team has gained from as early as the first semester of software engineering studies and the hands-on experience from previous projects, following an Agile methodology, Scrum to be specific, was the obvious choice.\\\\
The development process was split into two-week sprints, with Jira used as a tool for organization and keeping all team members on track. To ensure smooth development, each sprint had clear objectives that were decided during sprint planning meetings. Throughout those sessions, the backlog was populated with work items, which were assigned to adequate epics and split between team members.\\
During those two weeks the team combined online communication with in-person meetings, which frequency varied based on current needs. \\
After each sprint finished, sprint review sessions were held. During those meetings the team could reflect on the progress that was made. They were essential for understanding how much workload is realistic to complete in the span of two weeks, which was crucial for improving upcoming development and avoiding setting unrealistic expectations.  

\subsection{Technology Stack}

\subsubsection{Frontend}

For developing the frontend the team used React with Vite. Keeping the web application consistent across different pages was of great importance, therefore React, which is characterized by its component-based approach aligned with the teams vision. It made creating reusable user interface components possible, which made the development process easier by keeping the code clearer, easier to maintain and avoiding code repetition. Due to choosing Vite, the team was able to work in a fast development environment, since it provided quick feedback.\\
Prior to writing any code, a design was vital, thus Figma was the starting point of every frontend element. The team used a shared folder for all the designs, which also played an important role. Because the team members could see each others' designs, the application achieved a cohesive look, despite having six developers working on it.

\subsubsection{Backend}

The backend was implemented using Node.js with Express.js.

\subsubsection{Data Storage and Infrastructure}
-postgresgl
-docker
-pico board

\subsection{Version Control}
Git and GitHub were the tools used throughout the whole development of GetStanding. To keep the codebase stable, work was carried out in seperate branches rather than the main branch. In order to make the review process more manageable the team tried to stick to suitable and clear naming habits, that includes branches, commits, pull requests. Each pull request was reviewd by at least one other member and comments were left if necessary.\\
Collaborating this way and mutual support improved the team's spirit and contributed to the growth as developers.

\section{Problem Analysis}
\paragraph{} Many studies have demonstrated that prolonged sedentary behavior increases health risks such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases as well as
decreased productivity. Also beck pain, shoulder stiffness, lower back pain, and mental health issues have also been noted as common reasons for decreased work performance. 
\paragraph{}A study stated that people who predominantly sit at work have a 16 higher risk of mortality from all causes, and a 34\% higher risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease To counteract the increased risk, individuals who sit a lot at work would have to engage in an additional 15 to 30 minutes of physical activity per day to reduce their risk to that of individuals who do not predominantly sit, researchers estimated.
\paragraph{} This project will serve as a preventive health solution, aiming to encourage the users to adopt healthier habits during their workday. GetStanding aims to track and monitor the duration of sitting and provide their standing habit insights over time. By seeing their weekly performance and tracking progress, users stay motivated and consistent. In addition to this, GetStanding encourage the user to stand up or take a break after long sitting periods. 

\subsection{Key Challenges}
\paragraph{} The most important challenge with this project is to get the user to follow up on their daily statistics on standing as well as to make changes to their daily behavior by providing encouragement. The process of developing new habits is based on the amount of time and effort it takes to develop new habits therefore, many users may ignore the daily stats if they are too busy or if they lack the motivation. This may decrease the effectiveness of the proposed solution. 
\paragraph{} There are technical challenges in this project related to synchronizing data in real-time from the desk sensor, the user application, and the database. Synchronization delays or connectivity issues may prevent tracking stats from being sent, and thus decrease the overall effectiveness of the system. Addressing these challenges strategically will ensure that GetStanding effectively promotes a healthier and more productive workspace environment.
